# Automated Underwriting Engine using Big Data and ML  

ðŸš€ **Transforming traditional insurance underwriting with Big Data and Machine Learning.**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The insurance industry is constrained by outdated, manual underwriting practices that are slow, inconsistent, and prone to errors. This project develops a **real-time Automated Underwriting Engine** that leverages **Big Data technologies (Hadoop, Spark, AWS EMR)** and **Machine Learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.)** to:  

- Automate risk scoring and underwriting decisions.  
- Enhance decision accuracy and fraud detection.  
- Enable scalable analytics on large volumes of insurance application data.  
- Provide real-time, interactive visualizations via a **Streamlit dashboard**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Reduce manual underwriting workload with intelligent automation.  
- Deliver faster and more consistent underwriting decisions.  
- Improve customer experience with real-time processing.  
- Support insurers with insights into churn, claims, and risk factors.
